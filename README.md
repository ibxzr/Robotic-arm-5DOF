# Robotic-arm-5DOF
A 3D robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom designed in TinkerCAD.
# 🤖 Robotic Arm - 5 Degrees of Freedom (3D Model)

This project presents a 3D-designed robotic arm with 5 Degrees of Freedom (5DOF) built using TinkerCAD. The design simulates the basic movement capabilities of an actual robotic arm, including shoulder, elbow, wrist, and gripper components.

## 🧩 Arm Structure

| Part           | Description                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Base           | Stable foundation of the arm              |
| Shoulder Joint | First rotational axis                     |
| Elbow Joint    | Allows bending motion like human elbow    |
| Wrist Joint    | Provides rotational flexibility            |
| Gripper        | End effector used to grab objects         |
